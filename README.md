# JS-Audio-Trimmer

## Description:

A smiple way to trim audio files using nothing but pure Javascript and Typescript.
The project uses vanilla TS so you can implement it in your favorite framework.

**Note:**
The current implementation allows you to trim .wav file type, but you can do it with any other audio type you want, you just need to change the encoder, here I used wav encoder, check [audio-encoder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/audio-encoder) package for more encoders.
